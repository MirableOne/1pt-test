Ivan and I agreed to spend only **one** hour after I take dis-doc. So there are some thoughts about my result. 

I didn't run application at all. There is no 3rd party libs or solutions in case of only one hour.

I have no local php environment and create a new one with docker/phpstorm could take some time. 

There is no usage of open-api generator cause of 2 reasons:
1. I have used for golang, and it could be pretty complex task;
2. I have tried to generate server-side stubs for different languages, and the result wasn't really useful.

I tried to make some abstract-framework, but it was a bad idea. In other case set up the real one could be more time-consuming start.

There are no concrete realizations at all. In the most cases there are only classes with a few methods.
I wrote some `todo` and comments for clear ideas what to do next.
